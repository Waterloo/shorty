{"name":"Shorty","tagline":"A sample URL shorter like bit.ly and goo.gl in Node.js  using Express and Redis","body":"Shorty - URL shortner in node.js\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\nShorty is a simple short URL generator built using Node.js , Express.js and Redis\r\n\r\n![Shorty](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8742/16730466119_6f0b290769.jpg)\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n**Pre-requistes**\r\nfor Running shorty you need:\r\n - [Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/installation \"Installing Node.js\")\r\n - [Redis](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart \"Installing Redis\")\r\n \r\n > **Note:**\r\nYou can also use:\r\n - free node.js hosting plan from [Heroku](http://heroku.com/)\r\n - free redis 25mb plan from [Redis lab](http://redislabs.com\") , it can store about 75000 short urls\r\n\r\n**Step 1 : **\r\n\r\nOpen Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T on most Linux distributions) and clone the **shorty** repository from here\r\n\r\n> git clone https://github.com/Waterloo/shorty\r\n\r\n**Step 2 : **\r\n\r\nNavigate into the cloned directory\r\n\r\n> cd shorty\r\n\r\n**Step 3 : **\r\n\r\nInstall the required modules from Node.js for **shorty**\r\n\r\n> npm install\r\n\r\n**Step 4 : **\r\n\r\nIf you have installed a Redis server, you have to manually start the server.\r\n\r\n> redis-server\r\n\r\nNote the port number from the commands that appear on the screen.\r\n\r\nIf you're using a hosted Redis service, the default port number would be 6379. This will be detailed on the service provider's end when you sign up for the service.\r\n\r\nOnce you get your ***redis-server*** running, you won't have a shell ($) prompt. To get the shell prompt back, you could use the **Ctrl+Z** combination to push the redis-server to the background and get your shell prompt back.\r\n\r\n**Step 5 : **\r\n\r\nOpen **app.js** in a text editor of your choice (or an IDE) and replace the **port** to the port running the Redis server and **endpoint** to the host running the Redis server.\r\n\r\n> Note : if you have *redis-server* running locally on your machine, the endpoint should be the loopback address of your localhost : 127.0.0.1.\r\n> If you have a hosted redis service, the provider will provide you with a hostname which you can use as the endpoint.\r\n\r\n> var client = redis.createClient(port, 'endpoint');\r\n\r\nReplace the *password* with your Redis server password\r\n> client.auth('password', function (err)\r\n\r\n**Step 6 : **\r\n\r\nWith all the setup ready to roll, you can now run shorty from the terminal\r\n\r\n> node app.js\r\n\r\nThe terminal will show you the address from where you can access the ***shorty*** interface.\r\n\r\nHave fun shortening your favorite URLs with ***shorty***\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
